volume never picked up ,
not days highest green 
wait for pull back
bottoms up 
dying volume 


percentage : max (1.5 - 3)

before 9:45 short , if stock moves :
        less than 2.5 % => no short
        more than 2.5%-3.5%=> 1-2%
        more than 3.5%-5.0%=> 1.25-2.5%







for really bad day short signal : 
if stock has not fallen much and position is not PNQ 
then in that case
i would like to take short after first consolidation . 
expect the stock to sweep all consolidated highs in range and then move further . (1.25-2.5) . lets see this one
